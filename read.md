# 🔍 Blind-Aware Dynamic ROI Object Detection using YOLOv8

A real-time object detection system with **Dynamic Region of Interest (ROI)** logic using **YOLOv8**, designed to simulate smart navigation systems — such as assistive technology for the visually impaired.

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Perform object detection on video streams using YOLOv8.
- Define and dynamically shift an ROI (Region of Interest) to simulate smart navigation.
- Evaluate detection accuracy using dummy ground truth labels.
- Save output frames optionally for use in academic research or publications.
